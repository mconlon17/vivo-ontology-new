   contain the root `toctree` directive.

The VIVO Ontology
=========================================

We are learning about Sphinx and ReadTheDocs, and considering their use
for creating documentation for the VIVO Ontology and related ontologies.

One need is to provide search and index capability at the term level. A
user should be able to find the documentation for `date` or `person` or
`publication` without difficulty.  

Sphinx is *semantic* -- it fully separates document content and structure from 
document presentation.  Writers deal only with structure.  Stylesheets deal with presentation.
