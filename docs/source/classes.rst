Classes
==============
**Classes** are collections of individuals.  A person, a publication, a project, a role in a project are
all individuals.  Classes of **individuals** are defined by specifying members (extension) or more frequently 
in scholarship, by specifying conditions (intension).

In ontologies, and :ref:`OWL <glossary>`, individuals
instances of classes. Classes are arranged
in subsumption hierarchies.  For example, a cat is a mammal.  Your cat is an instance of the
class cat.  Cats are mammals.  We say cat is a subclass of mammal.  We can infer that all individuals that are
cats are mammals.
